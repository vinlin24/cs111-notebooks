The test-taking policy, from [the syllabus](Syllabus%20for%20CS%20111-1.pdf):

> Students will be permitted to take the tests during any time during the full twenty four hours of the day being given, to
accommodate students currently in different time zones. The tests will be open book, open notes. More details on the coverage of the tests will be given in the week before the test is scheduled.


## Notebook Organization


Tentative. I don't know the best way to do this since Professor is big on both slides and readings, making much of my effort arguably redundant.

One notebook per lecture. A "lecture" will be defined as however long it takes for Professor to go through the slides corresponding to "Lecture #", which may or may not be one-to-one with the 110 minute lecture sessions. As for the readings assigned for each lecture, I mostly just highlight some sentences I find most important or representative of their surrounding paragraphs - my philosophy is:

> Highlight, note, or outline in whatever way that **optimizes lookup time**, whether it be for visually scanning the text for a particular highlight color, referencing some cheatsheet that directs me to a particular passage, or just Ctrl+F in general for exams' sake.
